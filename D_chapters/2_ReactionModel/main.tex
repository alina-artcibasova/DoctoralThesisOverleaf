  "Why 1.11 meters? It doesn't seem like a terribly useful distance." \par
  "Well, no," replied Translator Zeiat, still frowning. "It wasn't meant to be a useful distance. In fact the distance wasn't meant at all [...] No, the bullets aren't designed to go through anything for 1.11 meters. They are designed to destroy Radchaai ships. That was what the purchasers required of them. The 1.11 meters is a kind of... accidental side effect sort of thing."}%

Stelling "A quantitative model for HDAC6-mediated virus uncoating predicts Influenza A infectivity". Alina Artcibasova designed and implemented the mathematical model, analyzed the model predictions, and how they compare to the experimental data, prepared figures, and co-wrote the manuscript.
