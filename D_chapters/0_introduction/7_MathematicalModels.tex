\section{Mathematical models allow functional analysis of biological systems}

A variety of mechanistic mathematical models has been used to analyze and elucidate function of cellular systems and viral infections.

For example, a process through which molecular motors may exert force onto influenza virus capsid layer is called Tug-of-War. Previously it has been described as a velocity and force balance between two types of microtubule motors to model endosomal transport \cite{muller2008tug}, and to prove that competetive and cooperative modes of molecular motor transport are not mutually exclusive.
