\section{HDAC6 Structure and Function}

Histone deacetylases are a class of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from chromatin and other acetylated proteins. Currently 18 HDAC proteins are known, which are classified into 4 classes. HDAC6 belongs to IIb class, which is primarily localized in the cytoplasm \cite{hai2016histone}.

Among other histone deacetylases HDAC6 is the only one to carry tandem catalytic domains CD1 and CD2 (Figure \ref{figure:HDAC6Domains}). Dynein motor binding (DMB) domain is located between them. HDAC6 also has a ubiquitin-binding domain ZnF ("zinc-finger") which senses polyubiquitinated misfolded protein cargo \cite{hai2016histone}. HDAC6-ZnF selectively binds to ubiquitin chains having unanchored C terminal diglycine \cite{ouyang2012protein} with a very high affinity \cite{zhang2008mice}.

HDAC6 deacetylates tubulin \cite{zhang2003hdac, zhang2008mice} (polymer making up the microtubules), and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) \cite{kovacs2005hdac6} (a chaperone protein which assists protein folding and degradation). HDAC6 senses ubiquitinated protein aggregates and triggers their clearance \cite{boyault2007hdac6}. HCAC6 also assists in stress granule formation and cellular oxidative stress recovery \cite{kwon2007deacetylase}.

During influenza infection, HDAC6 (specifically, HDAC6-ZnF) and other components of aggresome processing machinery - molecular motors myosin II and dynein - were essential for efficient uncoating. Involvement of molecular motors suggested that influenza uncoating is achieved through physical forces generated by microtubule- and actin-associated motors \cite{banerjee2014influenza}.
