Influenza viruses are negative sense RNA eukaryotic viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae \cite{Orthomyxoviridae2011}.

Influenza virus genomic RNA is packaged with protective nucleoprotein together with polymerase complexes. Influenza viruses carry eight unique viral RNA strands, packaged into ribonucleoprotein  (vRNP) segments. Through use of alternative mRNA splicing influenza A may encode up to 17 known proteins (Table \ref{table:fluSegments} \cite{das2010structures, dubois2014influenza}). Like most viruses, influenza undergoes antigenic drift - a gradual change in viral proteins due to accumulation of mutations. Thanks to segmented genome organization influenza is also capable of antigenic shift - a process of drastic change in viral proteins caused by exchange of vRNP segments during coinfection with other influenza strains. Antigenic shift is often thought to be responsible for zootonic influenza outbreaks.

Electron microscopy and singleâ€‘molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization studies provide evidence for selective packaging over random inclusion of the eight vRNP segments \cite{eisfeld2015centre}. However, there is a growing awareness that semi-infectious viral particles, which lack full set of vRNPs are also contributing towards viral infectivity.

Packaged vRNPs are protected by a protein shell (capsid) layer consisting mostly of matrix protein M1. This layer embeds ion channel M2, and transmembrane segments of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) spikes. On the outside, the capsid layer is covered with a protective lipid bilayer. This lipid bilayer originates from the host cell during the packaging and detachment process (Figure \ref{figure:fluStructure}).

The three largest vRNP segments - PB2, PB1, and PA - encode polymerase subunits responsible for viral RNA synthesis in the host cell nucleus.

Intermediate sized segments encode nucleoprotein (NP), which protects viral RNA strands, and two surface glycoprotein spikes HA and NA. The HA spike binds host cell-surface sialic acid receptors initiating viral entry. The NA spike cleaves sialic acid residues from the new viral particles to release them from the host cell.

Based on these glycoprotein spikes, influenza A viruses are categorized into antigenic subtypes. 18 HA and and 11 NA subtypes (named H1-18 and N1-11, respectively) have been identified so far \cite{InfluenzaAAntigenicSubtypes}. Thus, for example H3N2 virus contains a H3 subtype HA and a N2 subtype NA.

Segment M encodes the influenza matrix protein M1 which forms a protective capsid layer around vRNPs. Open reading frame shift during translation leads to production of ion channel protein M2, based on the same segment \cite{dubois2014influenza}.

Finally, the smallest segment NS encodes several non-structural proteins which assist the course of infection.

Influenza virus particles often carry host proteins, which they "borrow" from their host cell. Some of these host proteins, such as annexin A2, $\beta$-actin, and ubiquitin B are present in the virions in amounts exceeding native viral proteins NS1, M2, and NEP \cite{hutchinson2014conserved}. Currently, it is unclear whether these host proteins deliver any function during infection, or that their presence is simply an artifact of viruses hijacking cellular microvesicle formation pathways to produce enveloped virions \cite{hutchinson2014conserved}.
