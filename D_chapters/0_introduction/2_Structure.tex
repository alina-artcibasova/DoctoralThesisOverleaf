Influenza viruses are negative sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae \cite{Orthomyxoviridae2011}.

Influenza virus genomic RNA is packaged with protective nucleoprotein together with polymerase complexes. Influenza viruses carry eight unique viral RNA strands, packaged into ribonucleoprotein  (vRNP) segments (Table \ref{table:fluSegments} \cite{das2010structures, dubois2014influenza}). Through use of alternative mRNA splicing influenza A may encodes up to 17 known proteins.

Electron microscopy and singleâ€‘molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization studies provide evidence for selective packaging over random inclusion of the eight vRNP segments \cite{eisfeld2015centre}. However, there's a growing awareness that semi-infectious viral particles, which lack full set of vRNPs are also contributing towards viral infectivity.

Packaged vRNPs are protected by capsid layer consisting mostly of matrix protein M1. This layer embeds ion channel M2, and transmembrane segments of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) spikes. On the outside, capsid layer is covered with a protective lipid bilayer taken from the virus producing host cell during the packaging and detachment process (Figure \ref{figure:fluStructure}).

Three largest vRNP segments - PB2, PB1, and PA - encode polymerase subunits, responsible for viral RNA synthesis in the host cell nucleus.

Intermediate sized segments encode nucleoprotein (NP), which protects viral RNA strands, and two surface glycoprotein spikes HA and NA. HA spike binds host cell-surface sialic acid receptors initiating viral entry. NA spike on the other hand cleaves sialic acid residues from the new viral particles, to release them from the host cell.

Based on these glycoprotein spikes, influenza A viruses are categorized into antigenic subtypes. 18 HA and and 11 NA subtypes (named H1-18 and N1-11, respectively) have been identified so far \cite{InfluenzaAAntigenicSubtypes}. Thus, for example H3N2 virus contains a H3 subtype HA and a N2 subtype NA.

Segment M encodes influenza matrix protein M1 which forms a protective capsid layer around vRNPs. Open reading frame shift during translation leads to production of ion channel protein M2, based on the same segment \cite{dubois2014influenza}.

Finally, smallest segment NS encodes several non-structural proteins which assist the course of infection.

Influenza virus particles often carry host proteins, which they "borrow" from their host cell. Some of these host proteins, such as annexin A2, $\beta$-actin, and ubiquitin B are present in the virions in amounts exceeding native viral proteins NS1, M2, and NEP \cite{hutchinson2014conserved}. Currently, it is unclear whether those host proteins deliver any function during infection, or their presence is simply an artifact of viruses subverting cellular microvesicle formation pathways to produce enveloped virions \cite{hutchinson2014conserved}.
