\section{Influenza Virus Structure}

Influenza virus carries eight unique viral ribonucleoprotein  (vRNP) segments (Table \ref{table:fluSegments} \cite{das2010structures}).

\caption{Influenza virus vRNP segments}
\label{table:fluSegments}

\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{10cm}|}
\hline 
Segment&    Protein\\
\hline
PB2&    polymerase subunit PB2\\
PB1&    polymerase subunit PB1 and PB1-F2 protein with  apoptotic function\\
PA&     polymerase subunit PA and PA-X protein which regulates host translation shutoff \cite{khaperskyy2016selective}\\
HA&     haemagglutinin, which binds to the host cell-surface sialic acid receptors\\
NP&     nucleoprotein, which encapsidates the viral single-stranded RNAs\\
NA&     neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic acid residues from the new viral particles, releasing them from the host cell\\
M&      matrix M1 and ion channel M2\\
NS&     non-structural proteins NS1A, which suppresses host mRNA production and NEP, which assists vRNPs export from the nucleus\\
