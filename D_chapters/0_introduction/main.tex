Есть такое наблюдение: если насморк не лечить, то он пройдет через неделю, а если лечить, то через семь дней.

There's a following observation: if you don't treat the cold, it will pass in  week, but if you do, then it will pass in seven days.

\textit{In silico} modelling allows to examine an array of parameters and possibilities which would be difficult or impossible to characterise using traditional research methods \cite{colquitt2011silico}. Such flexibility allows the pursuit of two competing goals: to gain a new understanding of the system from the available knowledge, and to use available data to predict future progression of the system in question \cite{nguyen2016analysis}.

The recent example of COVID-19 pandemic brought to the light some of the viral \textit{in silico} modelling techniques. Amino-acid sequence based molecular modelling uses existing knowledge of protein folding to predict conformations of spike glycoproteins \cite{vankadari2020emerging} and their docking sites \cite{hall2020search}. Dynamic infection modelling primarily focuses on the second goal - assisting public health decisions by describing viral transmission, for example, by estimating case mortality \cite{anastassopoulou2020data}, or potential effectiveness of social policies \cite{giordano2020modelling}. Such applications of \textit{in silico} modelling make sense due to the time sensitive nature of a global pandemic, a novel under-researched pathogen, and existing limitations in data reporting.

Influenza is another viral pandemic threat \cite{sutton2018pandemic, taubenberger20191918}. However, unlike COVID-19, influenza has been extensively studied over the last 100 years, and we have lots of protein structure \cite{calder2010structural}, function \cite{pinto2006m2, lamb2001death}, and host interaction \cite{zhao2017influenza} information available. Despite this dearth of knowledge, influenza models still often use small datasets with few observed variables to fit a small model of infection \cite{smith2011influenza}, which are rarely examined under other experimental conditions \cite{dobrovolny2013assessing}. While there is a certain benefit to the use of tractable and easily understandable models, their minimalist structure doesn't allow for inference on specific molecular targets for intervention \cite{heldt2013multiscale}.

Attempts to introduce additional knowledge of underlying intracellular processes \cite{heldt2013multiscale, rudiger2019multiscale} often end up with models which may describe influenza infections in a bigger variety of experimental conditions, but also rely on many unobserved quantities and variables.

Ultimately, the struggle boils down to the problem all multiscale models face \cite{qu2011multi} - hierarchical organization of systems is an artifact of our ability to observe them. In a process of mathematical modelling we need to bridge these apparent gaps between observed spatial and temporal scales, while preserving the relevant detail, which makes the inclusion of smaller scales important.

In this work, we attempt to provide a case study for how such challenges can be approached. We use small scale models to answer specific questions about influenza infection, and then use approximated predictions made by those small scale models to make judgements about larger scale outcomes. This approach can, perhaps, be conceptualized as a "matryoshka" (Russian nesting doll): each individual doll can be used separately, but together they introduce the user to new concepts and experiences which a single doll would not able to represent sufficiently.
