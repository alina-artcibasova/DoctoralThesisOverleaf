\section{Host directed anti‐viral strategies}

Currently available influenza drugs  target viral proteins M2 and NA. This approach allows for a specific mechanism of action, which, ideally, shouldn't interfere with host cellular systems.

One significant problem with this approach, is that by introducing the antiviral drugs into the clinic, we exert evolutionary pressure on the virus, which, in turn, modifies its target protein to escape inhibition by the drug, and rendering the drug useless (e.g. adamantanes).

These concerns over antiviral drug resistance, and growing awareness of host proteins involvement in successful infection led to emergence of a new drug development approach. Instead of targeting a viral protein, we try to target a host cell protein, which does not directly interact with viral proteins, and therefore is not a subject to direct selection.

Conceptually such an approach can be understood through the story of a Troyan siege (Figure \ref{figure:fluTroy}). Much like a Trojan horse, which couldn’t make it inside the city without the help of its citizens, viruses require host protein help for successful infection. Choosing to target these host proteins in an antiviral treatment is alike to convincing the Troyans to leave the horse at the door.

A major challenge in host directed anti‐viral strategies is cellular toxicity (which, however is not exclusive this approach). It is a complex issue, which I believe is best addressed through a interrogating systemically the involvement of the protein in both cellular and viral processes, as well as elucidating specific mechanism of action of a drugging agent.

One such potential drug target host protein is histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), along with molecular motors myosin 10 and dynein, and their respective cytoskeletal filaments \cite{banerjee2014influenza}.
