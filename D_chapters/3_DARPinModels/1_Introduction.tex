\section{Introduction}


In Chapter \ref{ch:ReactionModels} we have established that our "Symmetric" and "Asymmetric" HDAC6 complex formation models are capable of predicting capsid breakage in normal and perturbed conditions. Our next point of interest is to try and use them to make predictions for cases for which we don't know the answer for.

One possible application has been suggested by the data provided by our collaborators from Patrick Matthias' group at FMI. They used designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) - artificial proteins which can bind target proteins with high affinity and specificity - to try and find one capable of inhibiting HDAC6-mediated influenza uncoating.

They showed that DARPin-F10 has a high specificity and affinity against HDAC6-ZnF \cite{DarpinData}. They were able to stably express and reversibly DARPin F10 in A549 cells. Using these new mutant cell lines they demonstrated that at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 30 plaque-forming units (PFU) /ml DARPin-F10 expression leads to the reduction in influenza viral uncoating (Figure \ref{figure:darpinUncoatingExperimental}), and at MOIs of 10 and 0.05 PFU/ml - to reduction virus production (Figure \ref{figure:darpinGrowthExperimental}).

Knowing that DARPin-F10 binds to HDAC6-ZnF we can with reasonably assume that during influenza uncoating it acts as a competitor against polyubiquitin chains. 

In this chapter, we use that assumption, and introduce DARPin-F10 to our HDAC6 complex formation models. We make predictions about DARPin-F10 active concentrations and dose-response behavior, and discuss the possibly of using these predictions to determine whether "Symmetric" or "Asymmetric" model best describes the biological system.
