\chapter{Modelling novel drug candidate dose response in influenza infection}
\label{ch:DARPin}

\dictum[Ann Leckie, "The Raven Tower"]{%
  One can make any number of careful and informed guesses, but until events occur any predictions are subject to error, to the extent that one's information, or one's understanding, may be incomplete. [...] The relevant question here, it seems to me, is not any of those things. It is, rather, Do you care?}%

Parts of this chapter were prepared during Pitt Meyer's 8-week research project "Modelling influenza A virus uncoating inhibition through host factor interaction" under Alina Artcibasova's supervision. Alina Artcibasova conceived the study, supervised the implementation of the mathematical model of DARPin-F10 mediated uncoating inhibition, and the analysis of the model predictions and parameter fitting. Alina Artcibasova performed literature data analysis, designed and implemented data-driven infection delay and  kinetic models, performed the fitting, prepared figures, and wrote the manuscript.
