  It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch - as he called himself - was persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and indeed the whole of Space. Not being able either to move or to see, save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it.}%

\Citet{Maxwell1865} derived some very useful equations for electromagnetic
fields:
\begin{align}
    \nabla \cdot \vec{D} = \rho \\
    \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 \\
    \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
    \nabla \times \vec{H} = \vec{j} + \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t}
\end{align}

The energy--momentum relation, \cref{eq:energy-momentum}, is one of \emph{my}
important results:
\begin{align}
    E^2 = m^2 c^4 + (p c)^2 \label{eq:energy-momentum}
\end{align}

Write units like this: \u{5}{\micro\meter}.
