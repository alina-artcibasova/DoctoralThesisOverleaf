I would like to thank Prof. J\"org Stelling for giving me an opportunity to work on this thesis. This project has been an exciting intellectual challenge, which gave me a wonderful opportunity to learn from you, both in terms of scientific integrity and leadership approach. Thank you, JÃ¶rg, for the scientific freedom you encouraged by you providing me opportunities to follow my curiosity, but also guidance, support, and encouragement whenever I needed help and insight.

It was a great pleasure to work with my collaborators on the VirX project. Our regular meetings helped me learn from you, and gain better understanding of the field, and how my own project fits into it. I thank my closest collaborator Longlong Wang  and his supervisor Prof. Patrick Matthias at FMI for providing me with their data and insights about protein interactions. I am grateful to Longlong for his enormous help and kindness in answering all sorts of questions about experimental methods and procedures I had. Discussing our results, and thinking of new scientific questions to pursue has been a highlight of my work. I thank Stephanie Anchisi and her supervisor Prof. Mirco Schmolke for providing me with their data and insights about the influence of M1 on influenza infection efficiency. I thank Prof. Yohei Yamauchi for providing me with influenza uncoating data, as well as his deep knowledge and great kindness in answering my questions about influenza uncoating. 

I thank the past and current members of the Computational Systems Biology group for all insightful discussions, intellectual and emotional support, friendly environment, and a fantastic atmosphere of striving to do better both in science and life.

I thank my student Pitt Meyer for his enthusiasm, curiosity, and insight. Mentoring you was a delightful experience which gave an opportunity to learn and self-reflect.

I thank my parents, Svetlana and Vyacheslav , and my siblings Anton and Angelica, for their unconditional love, support and encouragement to pursue my scientific interests. 

I thank my partner, Ming Yim, for always being here for me, even when we are separated by great distance.

Finally, I would like to thank Swiss Initiative for Systems Biology (SystemsX.ch, project VirX) for their financial support of interdisciplinary research.
